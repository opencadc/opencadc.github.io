<h1>ProductType vocabulary</h1>
<p>The ProductType vocabulary is a re-use of the 
<a href="https://www.ivoa.net/rdf/datalink/core">IVOA DataLink Core</a> vocabulary.</p>
<p>
Terms from the vocabulary may be used in CAOM instances as values of the caom2:Artifact.productType 
field. Terms in the base vocabulary are to be used without the URI prefix (e.g. "this" instead of 
http://www.opencadc.org/caom2/productType#this). As used in CAOM, Artifact.protuctType terms describe 
the relationship of the artifact to the plane; this is slightly different from describing what 
<em>type of file</em> the artifact is.
</p>

<p>
The following terms from the DataLink Core vocabulary are currently allowed in CAOM:
</p>

<ul>
<li>auxiliary
<li>bias
<li>calibration
<li>coderived
<li>dark
<li>documentation
<li>error
<li>flat
<li>noise
<li>preview
<li>preview-image
<li>preview-plot
<li>thumbnail
<li>weight
</ul>

<p>
The term "science" is currently allowed for backwards compatibility, but usage should
be replaced with "this" in future.
</p>

<p>
The term "calibration" was previously used to describe calibration artifacts in observations
with intent="calibration". This usage should also be replaced by "this" to indicate those
artifacts that are primary within the context of the observation and plane that contains them.
